# ioet Programing Test
* This app was made based on **JavaScript and Node.js**.
* Using a simple class named _Schedules.js_ to handle the input data. Then I use functions for making the operations on an _index.js_ file. In the majority of the code, I use splitters and substring functions to handle the data.
* I use **Mocha-chai** for testing, so you have to download the dependencies to test the app
## How to Run the app
* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
### This program needs a input.txt file to run
#### input.txt should have the next syntax:
* RENE=MO10:15-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH013:00-13:15,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00
* ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
### Then you can run the app
1. Run `npm start` to run the app.
2. Run `npm install`. Then `npm run test` for testing.
