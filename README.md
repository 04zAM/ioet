# ioet Programing Test
This app was made based on JavaScript and Node.js.\n
Using a simple class named Schedules.js to handle the input data.
Then I use functions for making the operations on an index.js file.\n
In the majority of the code, I use splitters and substring functions to handle the data.\n
I use Mocha-chai for testing, so you have to download the dependencies to test the app
## How to Run the app
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
### This program needs a input.txt file to run
#### input.txt should have the next syntax:
RENE=MO10:15-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH013:00-13:15,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00\n
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
### Then you can run the app
Run `npm start` to run the app.\n
Run `npm install`.
Then `npm run test` for testing.
